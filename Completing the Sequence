## Problem Statement: A string word with any combination of the letters "P," "Q," or "R" is supplied to you. 
Your objective is to figure out how many extra letters must be added to the string to be legitimate. 
A string is considered legitimate if it can be created by repeatedly concatenating the letter "PQR".
You are allowed to insert any number of letters "P," "Q," or "R" anywhere in the string and in any order. 
For example, if the string is "PPQRR", you can insert “QR” after the first “P”, and you can insert “PQ” before the last “R”, resulting in the string "PQRPQRPQR".
Note that this string is valid because it can be formed by concatenating "PQR" Thrice.

Input Format: The first line of input is an integer N, the length of the input string.
The second line of input is a string of length N, representing the input string to be checked.

Output Format: The program outputs a single integer, representing the minimum number of changes required to make the input string have a valid pattern.

Constraints: 1 <= N <= 10^5 

Sample Testcase 0: 
Testcase Input:
6
pqrppr
Testcase Output: 3
Explanation: We need to add QR after P (at 4th position) and Q after P (at 5th position) giving string "PQRPQRPQR".
